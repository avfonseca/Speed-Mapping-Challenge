README: sounding_svg.py

This script takes a template SVG of a sounding and modifies it to return the sounding of choice based on the input sounding. 

Some care has to be taken with the creation of the template, as this will not work with any SVG, and the size of the template must be 
considered or it may not show up in your GIS software. 

Choose, or create, your template, open it up in a text editor and take a look at it to see if the script will work. It searches for a 
specific input number based on the template (must be the same template or you need to change the script, this script is based off of a 
12.4m sounding) and modifies only those numbers.
